# X1 Carbon Gen 9
Various files and settings I am collecting as part of my new laptop setup and testing

## Monitor Calibration
This is a FHD+ touch panel from Innolux model N140JCN-GS9. The calibration file [N140JCN-GS9\*.icm](./screen-calibration) was taken with a Spyder 5 and DisplayCal under Windows 10 at full brightness. Adaptive brightness settings were disabled under Intel Graphic Command Center.

The DisplayCal results taken at full brightness show that this panel only goes as bright as 318 Nits at the centre of the screen.

## Performance Testing
There are two Cinebench R23 results (tekan on battery and pulgged in). Both results are taken after already running the test at least once, and Windows power mode slider all the way to the right on "Best Performance". Fan noise was a pleasant "whoosh" sounds and not annoying. Thermals were not measured.
